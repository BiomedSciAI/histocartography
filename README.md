Welcome to the `histocartography` repository! `histocartography` is a python-based library designed to ease the development of computational pathology pipelines. The library offers plug-and-play modules to address a number of common tasks in digital pathology, e.g., stain normalization, nuclei detection, tissue detection. Even more, `histocartography` includes a set helpers to work with graph-based representation of histology images. Features range from cell graph generation of an H&E image to Graph Neural Network-based modeling. All the features are grouped under a user-friendly API. 

If you encounter any issue or have questions regarding the library, feel free to [open a GitHub issue](add_link), we'll do our best to address it. 

# Installation 

## PyPI installer (recommended)

`pip install histocartography`

## Development setup 

- Clone the repo:

```
git clone <ADD-PUBLIC-URL> && cd histocartography
```

- Create a conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- Activate it:

```
conda activate histocartography
```

- Add `histocartography` to your python path:

```
export PYTHONPATH="<PATH>/histocartography:$PYTHONPATH"
```

## Tests

To ensure proper installation, run unit tests as:

```sh 
python -m unittest discover -s test -p "test_*" -v
```

Running tests on cpu can take up to 20mn. 

# Using histocartography 

The `histocartography` library provides a set of helpers grouped in different modules, namely `preprocessing`, `visualization`, `ml` and `interpretability`.  

For instance, in `histocartography.preprocessing`, detecting nuclei in an H&E image is as simple as:

```
>> from histocartography.preprocessing import NucleiExtractor
>> 
>> detector = NucleiExtractor()
>> image = np.array(Image.open('images/283_dcis_4.png'))
>> instance_map, _ = detector.process(image)
```

The output can be then visualized with:

```
>> from histocartography.visualization import InstanceImageVisualization
>> 
>> visualizer = InstanceImageVisualization()
>> canvas = visualizer.process(image, instance_map=instance_map)
>> canvas.show()
```

A list of examples to discover the capabilities of the `histocartography` library is provided in `examples`. The examples will show you how to perform:

- **stain normalization** with Vahadane or Macenko algorithm
- **cell graph generation** to transform an H&E image into a graph-based representation where nodes encode nuclei and edges nuclei-nuclei interactions. It includes: nuclei detection based on HoverNet pretrained on PanNuke dataset, deep feature extraction and kNN graph building. 
- **tissue graph generation** to transform an H&E image into a graph-based representation where nodes encode tissue regions and edges tissue-to-tissue interactions. It includes: tissue detection based on superpixels, deep feature extraction and RAG graph building. 
- **feature cube extraction** to extract deep representations of individual patches depicting the image
- **cell graph explainer** to generate an explanation to highlight salient nodes. It includes inference on a pretrained CG-GNN model followed by GraphGradCAM explainer. 

A tutorial with detailed descriptions and visualizations of some of the main functionalities is provided [here](https://github.com/maragraziani/interpretAI_DigiPath/blob/feature/handson2%2Fpus/hands-on-session-2/hands-on-session-2.ipynb) as a notebook.
